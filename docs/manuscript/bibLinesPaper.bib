	abstract = {This paper presents the development of adaptive noise cancelation systems for improving the intelligibility of speech transmitted in hands-free cellular phones. Both periodic and random noise cancelation techniques are developed. A narrow band noise cancelation technique, which generates the reference signal internally, thereby achieving selective cancelation of harmonics for reducing the speech distortion is proposed. The theory and design issues of subbands are explored and their application to noise cancelation is verified. A multiple channel subband adaptive noise canceler is developed to deal with the multipath, multisource nature of the noise present in the car and its effectiveness was verified through computer simulations, which were carried out using real transfer functions estimated by an HP3563A Control Systems Analyzer.}

Irrespective of the configuration or implementation approach, the strategies proposed in the open-literature have focused on implementations where the control system for each ear of the headphones operates independently. In this paper, a multi-reference ANC strategy is proposed and investigated for noise cancelling headphones. As with standard feedforward ANC headphones, the system utilises a single error microphone and single reference microphone on each cup; however, in the proposed configuration, the left and right reference microphones are used to achieve control at both the left and right ear cups. The performance of this controller design is compared to a standard single reference feedforward controller implementation under a variety of different sound field conditions. Although the proposed strategy requires an increased computational demand, it is shown that there is a significant control advantage for noise sources originating from the side of the user, whilst the performance for front and rear sources is maintained.}",

	abstract = {An adaptive filter with a large number of weights or taps is necessary for stereophonic acoustic echo cancellation (SAEC), depending on the room impulse response and acoustic path where the cancellation is performed. However, a large tap-length results in slow convergence and increases the complexity of the tapped delay line structure for FIR adaptive filters. To overcome this problem, there is a need for an optimum tap-length-estimation algorithm that provides better convergence for the adaptive filters used in SAEC. This paper presents a solution to the problem of balancing convergence and steady-state performance of long length adaptive filters used for SAEC by proposing a new tap-length-optimization algorithm. The optimum tap length and step size of the adaptive filter are derived considering an impulse response with an exponentially-decaying envelope, which models a wide range of acoustic echo paths. The tap-length optimization is applied to a single long adaptive filter with thousands of coefficients to decrease the total number of weights, which in turn reduces the computational load. To further increase the convergence rate, the proposed tap-length-optimization algorithm is applied to an existing multiple sub-filter-based echo canceller, for which we present a convergence analysis. Computer simulations are also presented, comparing the proposed approach with related work.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a tap-length-adaptation algorithm is proposed for adaptive feedback cancellation (AFC) in the adaptive filter used in digital hearing aids. The existing state-of-the-art feedback cancellers use a fixed-length adaptive filter, which might over-model or under-model the feedback path. To overcome the issue of selecting a fixed arbitrary tap-length value, a unique automatic tap-length-variation algorithm is proposed for the adaptive filter. A key tap-length-update parameter, which ensures a balance between the deviation between steady-state and optimal values of the tap length and influences the convergence speed of the tap-length adaptation, has also been made adaptive for efficient feedback path estimation. A detailed mathematical performance-analysis of the proposed algorithm at steady state is performed. Computer simulations verify that the derived expressions predict the proposed algorithm’s improved performance over that of the existing algorithms.}

	ABSTRACT = {Since the early stages of operation of ground-based gravitational-wave interferometers, careful monitoring of these detectors has been an important component of their successful operation and observations. Characterization of gravitational-wave detectors blends computational and instrumental methods of investigating the detector performance. These efforts focus both on identifying ways to improve detector sensitivity for future observations and understand the non-idealized features in data that has already been recorded. Alongside a focus on the detectors themselves, detector characterization includes careful studies of how astrophysical analyses are affected by different data quality issues. This article presents an overview of the multifaceted aspects of the characterization of interferometric gravitational-wave detectors, including investigations of instrumental performance, characterization of interferometer data quality, and the identification and mitigation of data quality issues that impact analysis of gravitational-wave events. Looking forward, we discuss efforts to adapt current detector characterization methods to meet the changing needs of gravitational-wave astronomy.},

	ABSTRACT = {Gravitational waves astronomy allows us to study objects and events invisible in electromagnetic waves. It is crucial to validate the theories and models of the most mysterious and extreme matter in the Universe: the neutron stars. In addition to inspirals and mergers of neutrons stars, there are currently a few proposed mechanisms that can trigger radiation of long-lasting gravitational radiation from neutron stars, such as e.g., elastically and/or magnetically driven deformations: mountains on the stellar surface supported by the elastic strain or magnetic field, free precession, or unstable oscillation modes (e.g., the r-modes). The astrophysical motivation for continuous gravitational waves searches, current LIGO and Virgo strategies of data analysis and prospects are reviewed in this work.},
